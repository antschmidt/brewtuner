  <h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations.
    Your information may be disclosed as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>By Law or to Protect Rights:</strong> If we believe the release of
      information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to
      investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect
      the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information
      as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We may share your
      information with third parties that perform services for us or on our
      behalf, including data storage, hosting services, and customer service.
      Our primary service providers are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nhost (for backend infrastructure, database, and authentication). You
          can review Nhost's privacy policy on their website.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vercel (for hosting the frontend application). You can review Vercel's
          privacy policy on their website.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Tracking Technologies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Cookies and Web Beacons:</strong> We may use cookies, web beacons,
      tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on the Service to help
      customize the Service and improve your experience. When you access the
      Service, your personal information is not collected through the use of
      tracking technology. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default.
      You can remove or reject cookies, but be aware that such action could
      affect the availability and functionality of the Service (e.g.,
      authentication, theme preferences).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Local Storage:</strong> We use local storage for purposes such as
      storing your authentication session (via Nhost) and your theme
      preferences.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help
    protect your personal information. These measures are largely reliant on the
    security practices of our third-party providers like Nhost and Vercel. While
    we and our providers have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal
    information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no
    security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data
    transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of
    misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and
    misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete
    security if you provide personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>Policy for Children</h2>
  <p>
    We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the
    age of 13 (or higher age as required by applicable law). If you become aware
    of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us
    using the contact information provided below.

  <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
  <p>
    The Service may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for
    the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users
    to be aware when they leave our Service and to read the privacy statements
    of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
    any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the
    "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
    periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective
    when they are posted on this page.
